# Core functionality

### [Features](broken-reference)

* **Multi-instance deployment –** Trigger deployments of the same project to multiple environments from one place using the same or various configurations.
* **Instant test environments –** Seamless testing whenever your team wants to test the application, without waiting for a SysAdmin to set up an environment.
* **Configuration management –** You can manage your configuration in one place on dyrector.io. One organized place where you can give access to secrets and variables.\
  **In progress:** Specify bundled configuration variables instead of going through them one-by-one, repeatedly.
* **Monitoring –** Get notified if a deployment is successful or any failure occurred. Gain better understanding on how your infrastructure and applications perform.
* **Audit log –** We’re creating activity logs so you can reconstruct what might have caused a failure on your infrastructure.
* **Chat notifications –** Get automated messages about events and actions that occur on your infrastructure to spare the extra steps of manually notifying your team.

#### [Features in progress](../docs/learn-more/roadmap/features-in-progress.md)

* **Changelogs –** You're able to create changelogs at ease based on commit messages with the help of Conventional Commits, so your team understands the purpose of new versions. This simplifies communication between departments who work on the product and outsiders, for example decision-makers. The generated changelogs can be sent out via e-mail or any chatbot integration.
* **Secret management –** Store and manage sensitive data with our Vault integration powered by HashiCorp.
* **RBAC – Role based access control** lets you distribute privileges based on their responsibilities to your teammates. This is important to prevent any wrongdoing in case a user profile gets corrupted.
* **ChatOps solutions –** Interact with dyrector.io via chat messages on the chat platform your team uses.
