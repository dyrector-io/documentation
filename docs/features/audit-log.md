# Audit log

Keep track of the actions your teammates execute with dyrector.io. This way if a malfunction occurs, you can understand if it was due to a specific action or an outside factor.

We track user ID, time and unsensitive data related to actions on the platform. Audit logging on our platform only monitors actions executed by dyrector.io users.

We don't get access to self-managed dyrector.io logs.
