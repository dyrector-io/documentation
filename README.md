### **dyrector.io introduction**

#### UI & API for Kubernetes and Docker container management

dyrector.io is a delivery platform that helps you by substituting Docker and Kubernetes command line interactions with abstractions. You're able to configure any OCI compatible containers with a configuration screen, and in a JSON-editor, as well.

You can use the platform by installing its agents on your infrastructure. The agent will communicate with the platform to conduct interactions with containers running on your infra.

#### **Cloud provider & technology agnostic platform**

**dyrector.io is ready to interact with your already existing infrastructure and clusters right away.** The platform interacts with any cloud & on-premises infrastructure. Deploy images from any registry.

The platform can be used without moving your services to a brand new infrastructure. To provide quick setup, we don't offer any infrastructure to our users.

#### Integrations to the most popular tools

Chat notifications on Discord, Slack, and Teams let you and your team know about newly made deployments and versions to increase collaboration.

### When to use dyrector.io

✅ You already have a Kubernetes cluster and want to manage it with ease.

✅ Multiple users on your team need to have access to your containers for management.

✅ You'd like to configure versions once, without repetition.

✅ Your team needs self-service deployments for QA or sales purposes.
