# Minecraft Server

**Minecraft needs no introduction. You can setup a Minecraft Server by following the steps of deployments as documented** [**here**](../../docs/tutorials/deploy-your-product.md)**. Image is available with `latest` tag as a template.**

Once the deployment is successful, the server is ready to use at [**http://localhost:25565/**](http://localhost:25565/) by default.
