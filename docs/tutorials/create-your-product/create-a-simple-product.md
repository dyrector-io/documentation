# Create a versionless project

Versionless projects have only one abstracted-away version and cannot be rolled back. These are mostly useful for testing purposes.

**Step 1:** On the Project tab, click ‘Add’ on top right.

**Step 2:** Enter the project’s name.

{% endhint %}

**Step 3:** Select the versionless type under the description.
