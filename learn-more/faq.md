# FAQ

### Can I use dyrector.io without containerization?

Unfortunately we don't support applications that don't run in a containerized environment.

### Is dyrector.io Kubernetes specified?

No. It can be configured with any environment, cloud or on-premises, Docker or Kubernetes. Read how you can [**set up Nodes**](../docs/tutorials/register-your-node.md).

### **Can I use the self-managed platform with NGINX?**

Yes. Find the NGINX example [**here**](../self-managed/proxies.md#nginx).

### Can I deploy my images to a cluster orchestrated by Kind?

Yes.

### Is it a CI/CD tool?

The platform provides [**CD capabilities**](../features/continuous-deployment.md), but it doesn't offer CI, as of now. Such capabilities are in our long-term plans.

### Is it only for businesses?

dyrector.io is for anyone who works with containerized applications. That means organizations, or independent developers can gain advantage of the platform's functions.

### Will the tool remain completely free in the future?

Self-managed use will stay 100% free and unrestricted. But most of our team works full-time on the platform. While we gain some revenue as a cloud consultancy, we accept [**donations**](https://opencollective.com/dyrectorio-platform) to fund the project.

### What was the motivation behind making this tool?

We needed a solution for self-service release management capabilities for an entire different project. We couldn't find one that fit exactly our needs, so we made our own platform.
