# Vaultwarden

**Vaultwarden is a self-hosted Bitwarden implementation. Image is available with `latest` tag as a dyrector.io template.**

After the Node where you'd like to run Vaultwarden is [**registered**](../../docs/tutorials/register-your-node.md), you can set it up by following the steps of deployments as documented [**here**](../../docs/tutorials/deploy-your-product.md).

Once the deployment is successful, self-managed Vaultwarden is ready to use at [**localhost:80**](https://localhost:80) by default.
