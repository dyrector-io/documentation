# WordPress

[**WordPress**](https://wordpress.com/) **is the most popular CMS. More than 43% of all websites are managed with it. dyrector.io users can quickly set it up wherever they host their website they'd like to manage with WordPress. Image is available with `latest` tag on dyrector.io.**

After the Node where they'd like to run WordPress is [**registered**](../../tutorials/register-your-node.md), users can setup WordPress by following the steps of deployments as documented [**here**](../../tutorials/deploy-your-product.md).

Once the deployment is successful, WordPress is ready to use at [**localhost:4444**](http://localhost:4444) by default, as seen below.
