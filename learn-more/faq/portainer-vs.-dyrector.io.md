# Portainer vs. dyrector.io

Portainer is a popular Docker GUI for containerized applications. It supports Docker, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes orchestrated runtimes.

The most important difference between Portainer and dyrector.io is the feature-rich release management capability the latter offers for containerized applications. You're able to configure and deploy your application's containerized stack with dyrector.io.

While you can trigger multi-instance deployments with dyrector.io, Portainer offers single-node deployments.

### Which to choose?

Portainer is very useful for teams who would like to interact with containerized applications and their infrastructure in a simple manner. Its Community Edition leaves room for many Docker specific use cases, but some premium features are only available in the Business Edition which offers limited usage for free users.

dyrector.io offers more for teams who develop their own software and want to manage its versions as a containerized stack, and then deploy them to a single or multiple deployment targets with a single click. Self-managed dyrector.io is 100% open-source without usage limitations.
