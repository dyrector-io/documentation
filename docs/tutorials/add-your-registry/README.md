# Add your Registry

Registries are where the images you'd like to deploy are collected. While there are multiple registries explicitly supported, all OCI registries are supported. You can add registries from the following sources:

* [**V2 compatible registries**](add-v2-registry.md)
* [**Docker Hub**](add-docker-hub-registry.md)
* [**GitHub**](add-github-registry.md)
* [**GitLab**](add-gitlab-registry.md)
* [**Google**](add-google-registry.md)
* [**Unchecked**](../../../tutorials/add-your-registry/add-google-registry-1.md)
