# dyrector.io documentation

dyrector.io is an open-source container management platform that offers self-service Docker and Kubernetes deployment and configuration management capabilities to any cloud or on-premises infrastructure with a UI and API.

**You can find dyrector.io's repository on** [**GitHub**](https://github.com/dyrector-io/dyrectorio)**.**

### **dyrector.io as a platform**

dyrector.io turns your deployments as simple as you want them to be. If you need a CD tool to push your images coming from your CI workflows, you can do that with dyrector.io. In other cases, if you require someone to administer and validate deployments and trigger them in a self-service manner due to regulatory reasons, the platform can help you with that, too.

dyrector.io is a platform for:

* **individual engineers,** who'd rather spend time developing their applications instead of deploying them,
* **early stage startups,** who need Ops but don't have the resources to manage operational overhead,
* **organizations** in need of DevOps knowledge.

### **Why choose dyrector.io**

#### Intuitive UI accelerates deployments in Kubernetes & Docker

dyrector.io leaves room for self-service deployment processes due to its easy-to-use UI. The straightforward flow leads all users through the deployment process from assembling your product or version from your images, setting up its configuration and deploying it to your node.

Compared to similar products, dyrector.io's use cases aren't restricted to cloud providers. Users can utilize the platform's deployment capabilities with their already existing infrastructure regardless of the way they host their applications.

#### Simplified container & microservices architecture management independent from all cloud providers

dyrector.io reduces administration overhead, since it opens up the possibility for non-specialists to manage deployments on a high level and DevOps engineers to make deep level adjustments. Automatic deployment logs make it easier to understand the versions running on your infrastructure.

#### Configuration management for engineers & non-technical staff

Configuration management capabilities are provided with filter views for Kubernetes, Docker and common variables for quick variable specification. The JSON editor allows DevOps staff to handle configuration variables on their own terms without investigating YAML files.

If you ever decide to leave dyrector.io, you can keep your infrastructure related data by generating a YAML file containing all of your configurations.

### Integrations

dyrector.io supports various registry types, including Docker Hub registries, Docker API V2 compatible ones, GitLab, GitHub, and Google registries.
