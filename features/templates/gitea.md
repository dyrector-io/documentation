# Gitea

[**Gitea**](https://gitea.io/en-us/) **is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Image is available with `latest` tag on dyrector.io.**

After the Node where users would like to run Gitea is [**registered**](../../tutorials/register-your-node.md), users can set it up by following the steps of deployments as documented [**here**](../../tutorials/deploy-your-product.md).

Once the deployment is successful, Gitea is ready to use at [**http://localhost:3000/**](http://localhost:3000/) by default, as seen below.
