### When to use the platform

* You already have a Kubernetes cluster and want to manage it with ease.
* Multiple users on your team need to have access to your containers for management.
* You'd like to configure versions once, without repetition.
* Your team needs self-service deployments for QA or sales purposes.

### **Platform introduction**

#### UI & API for container management

A delivery platform that helps you by substituting Docker and Kubernetes command line interactions with abstractions. You're able to configure any OCI compatible containers with a configuration screen, and in a JSON-editor, as well.

You can use the platform by installing its agents on your infrastructure. The agent will communicate with the platform to conduct interactions with containers running on your infra.

#### **Cloud provider & technology agnostic platform**

**The platform is ready to interact with your already existing infrastructure and clusters right away.** The platform interacts with any existing cloud & on-premises infrastructure, as we don't offer infra. You can deploy images from any registry you have access to.

The platform can be used without moving your services to a brand new infrastructure. To provide quick setup, we don't offer any infrastructure to our users.

#### Integrations to the most popular tools

Chat notifications on Discord, Slack, and Teams let you and your team know about newly made deployments and versions to increase collaboration.
