# Pricing

The platform is currently in the making, and so is its pricing. The public alpha hosted by us is completely free. If you want to give the platform a try [**hosted by yourself**](broken-reference), you can do it, free of charge, forever.

Our plan with pricing is to have one, limited free package, and multiple paid plans with different usage caps. Paid users will have access to prioritized support compared to free users, and they're going to be able to manage more nodes, projects, and deployments in the platform.
