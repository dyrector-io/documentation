dyrector.io is currently in the making. The public beta hosted by us is going to roll out soon, which will be completely free to use. If you want to give dyrector.io a try hosted by yourself, you can do it, too, free of charge.

**For informative purposes, we plan to provide the packages below after beta accessibility.**
